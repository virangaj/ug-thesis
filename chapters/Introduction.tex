All the pages in the Project Report/Thesis must be computer printed only on one side of the page using
Times New Roman (size 12) font with 1.5-line spacing.
However, the following components of the project report/thesis should have single-line spacing: declaration, abstract, acknowledgment, table of contents, list of tables, list of figures, list of abbreviations, table titles, figure captions, and references. 
Each reference must be separated by a single-line spacing. Margins on each page must be maintained as
follows: left hand, 40 mm; right hand, 15 mm; top and bottom, 25 mm.
